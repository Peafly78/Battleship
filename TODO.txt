must have:

inp - rules

y - grid

y - populate fields randomly

- let player select difficulty level and set how many tries they have accordingly




todo:

- explain rules a bit better 
- include empty lines for better visuals

done:
- create hit list
- display hits to player
- tell player when he has won
- define different ship types
- define function for game, so that it can be replayed
- show the solution playfield if player lost (input Louisa), along with a list of shots (entries)
- add code to tell the player that they have sunk a ship
- show when a ship has been sunk (input Louisa)
- use pop() to remove elements from occupied list
