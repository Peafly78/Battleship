must have:

y - rules

y - grid

y - populate fields randomly

y - show results of guesses

y - run a guess count and show at the end




nice to have:

n - have player press enter for every new line of text (really?)

maybe later - compare high scores
maybe later - let player select difficulty level and set how many tries they have accordingly
maybe later - mark neighboring fields as water fields once ship has been sunk (could be tied to difficulty level


todo:

done:
- create hit list
- display hits to player
- tell player when he has won
- define different ship types
- define function for game, so that it can be replayed
- show the solution playfield if player lost (input Louisa), along with a list of shots (entries)
- add code to tell the player that they have sunk a ship
- show when a ship has been sunk (input Louisa)
- use pop() to remove elements from occupied list
- include random placement of ships in game definition, so that player can have more than one round with different playing field
- include empty lines for better visuals
- explain rules a bit better 
- improve grammar (e.g. 1 missiles)
- have player name appear more often
- ask for name again if string empty
- ask for new input if not y or n
