must have:

- rules

- grid

- populate fields randomly

- show results of guesses

- run a guess count and show at the end




nice to have:

- have player press enter for every new line of text

- compare high scores
- let player select difficulty level and set how many tries they have accordingly




todo:

- explain rules a bit better and define different ship types

- create hit list
- display hits to player
- use pop() to remove elements from occupied list
- tell player when he has won
- add code to tell the player that they have sunk a ship
