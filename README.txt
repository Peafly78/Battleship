The Ultimate Battleship Experience

--- Battleship Terminal Game (1 player mode) ---

Rules: 
The programm will hide 10 ships. Together they occupy a total of 20 fields.
The ships can be distributed horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
None of the ships touches another (not even diagonally).
The ships contain 1 carrier (4 fields), 2 battleships (3 fields), 3 carriers (2 fields) and 4 destroyers (1 field).
A notification will be displayed, once a ship has been sunk. Another notification will be displayed once all ships of the same category (e.g. all carriers) have been sunk.
The player has 75 missiles at their disposal. If they manage to sink all the ships, THEY WIN.
If not, the program wins.

How to play:
This is a terminal game, meaning you run it in the terminal of your choice (e.g. Bash), provided you have Python installed.
To play you follow the text instructions inside the game and use the keyboard for your input.
The game has been created using Python 3.9.7

About:
This is the final project for the "Learn Python 3" course on codecademy.com, created by Peafly_78.

Planned for version 2:
° keep a running total of how many games the player has won/lost in the current session.
° let the player select a difficulty level at the start of the game:
  - easy: around 90 missiles at disposal, once ship has been sunk, neighboring fields will be displayed as water
  - medium: like easy, only around 70 missiles at disposal
  - hard: around 60 missiles, neighboring fields will not automatically be displayed as water once a ship has been sunk (just like in the current version 1)
  - extreme: like hard, only around 50 missiles
This list of enhancements is subject to change.
