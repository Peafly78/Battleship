The Ultimate Battleship Experience

--- Battleship Terminal Game (1 player mode) ---

Rules: 
The programm will hide 10 ships. Together they occupy a total of 20 fields.
The ships can be distributed horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
None of the ships touches another (not even diagonally).
The ships contain 1 carrier (4 fields), 2 battleships (3 fields), 3 carriers (2 fields) and 4 destroyers (1 field).
A notification will be displayed, once a ship has been sunk. Another notification will be displayed once all ships of the same category (e.g. all carriers) have been sunk.
Depending on the selected difficulty level the player has 80, 70, 60 or 50 missiles at their disposal. If they manage to sink all the ships, THEY WIN.
If not, the program wins.
The program is set up so that several rounds can be played in one session and keeps a running total for games played, won and lost.

How to play:
This is a terminal game, meaning you run it in the terminal of your choice (e.g. Bash), provided you have Python installed.
To play you follow the text instructions inside the game and use the keyboard for your input.
The game has been created using Python 3.9.7
For the convenience of users who would like to play the game without installing Python an .exe file was created and provided for download.
